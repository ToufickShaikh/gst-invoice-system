# Button Navigation Testing Guide

## How to Test the Dashboard Navigation Buttons

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser and Navigate to Dashboard
- Go to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite shows)
- Login to access the dashboard

### 3. Test the Buttons
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab.

#### Quick Actions Section:
- **Create Invoice** - Should log "Create Invoice button clicked" and navigate to Billing page
- **Add Customer** - Should log "Add Customer button clicked" and navigate to Customers page  
- **Add Item** - Should log "Add Item button clicked" and navigate to Items page
- **View Reports** - Should log "View Reports button clicked" and navigate to Invoices page

#### Work Assignments Section:
- **Assign Task** - Should log "Assign Task button clicked" and navigate to Assignments page
- **Manage Workers** - Should log "Manage Workers button clicked" and navigate to Assignments page
- **Track Progress** - Should log "Track Progress button clicked" and navigate to Assignments page

### 4. What to Look For:

#### If buttons work correctly:
- Console logs appear when clicking buttons
- Page navigation occurs successfully
- URL changes in browser address bar

#### If buttons don't work:
- No console logs = Click handlers not firing (possible CSS/HTML issue)
- Console logs but no navigation = React Router issue
- JavaScript errors in console = Code syntax/import issue

### 5. Common Issues and Solutions:

#### Issue: Buttons not clickable
- **Check**: CSS z-index issues, overlapping elements
- **Solution**: Inspect element to see if button is actually clickable

#### Issue: Navigation not working
- **Check**: React Router setup, useNavigate hook
- **Solution**: Verify routes exist in AppRoutes.jsx

#### Issue: Console errors
- **Check**: Import statements, component syntax
- **Solution**: Fix syntax errors and rebuild

### 6. Test Alternative Access
If main buttons don't work, try accessing pages directly:
- `/billing` - Billing page
- `/customers` - Customers page  
- `/items` - Items page
- `/invoices` - Invoices page
- `/assignments` - Assignments page
- `/test-nav` - Navigation test page

### 7. Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify network requests in Network tab
3. Test other buttons on same page
4. Check if other pages' navigation works
5. Try refreshing the page
6. Clear browser cache if needed
