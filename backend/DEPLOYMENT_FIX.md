# Deployment Verification Guide

## ðŸš¨ CORS Issue Resolution

The error indicates that the frontend cannot connect to the backend. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. **Check Render Deployment Status**
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Verify that `gst-invoice-system-back` service is **running** and **healthy**
- Check the deployment logs for any errors

### 2. **Verify Environment Variables on Render**
Make sure these are set in your Render service:
```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
UPI_ID=shaikhtool@ibl
```

### 3. **Backend Health Check**
Test if the backend is responding:
```
https://gst-invoice-system-back.onrender.com/
https://gst-invoice-system-back.onrender.com/api/health
```

### 4. **Redeploy if Needed**
If the backend is not responding:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Find your backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" to redeploy with latest changes

### 5. **CORS Configuration**
The backend now includes enhanced CORS handling for:
- `https://shaikhgst.netlify.app` (your frontend)
- Explicit preflight request handling
- Better error reporting

### 6. **Database Connection**
If MongoDB connection fails, the server will still start but log the error.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Test Commands

Test locally:
```bash
npm start
```

Test health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://gst-invoice-system-back.onrender.com/api/health
```

## ðŸ“‹ Files Updated for CORS Fix:
- `app.js` - Enhanced CORS configuration
- `server.js` - Better error handling and logging
- `health-check.js` - Standalone health check server

## âœ… Next Steps:
1. Redeploy the backend on Render
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Test the health endpoint
4. Try creating an invoice from the frontend
