# Unused Files Analysis - Safe to Delete

This document lists files that can be safely deleted without affecting core functionality. All files have been analyzed for dependencies and usage patterns.

## üìÑ Documentation Files (Safe to Delete)

### README Files
- `README.mdx` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (duplicate documentation)
- `README-ADVANCED.md` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (development guide)
- `SETTINGS_FUNCTIONALITY.md` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (feature documentation)

### Deployment & Troubleshooting Guides
- `VPS_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (deployment documentation)
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (deployment guide)
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (deployment instructions)
- `BILLING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (troubleshooting guide)

**Reason:** Multiple README files exist. Keep only the main `README.md` file. Deployment and troubleshooting guides are reference material not required for functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Debug & Testing Scripts (Safe to Delete)

### Backend Debug Scripts
- `backend/verify-imports.js` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (import verification test)
- `backend/health-check-test.js` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (health check testing)
- `backend/full-backend-check.js` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (comprehensive backend testing)

### Shell Scripts
- `check-local-setup.sh` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (local environment verification)
- `fix-vps.sh` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (VPS troubleshooting script)
- `fix-common-issues.sh` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (issue fixing utility)

**Reason:** These are development and debugging utilities. The application doesn't import or depend on these files for runtime functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Planning Files (Safe to Delete)

### Planning Documents
- `OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.js` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (planning document, not functional code)

### Config Files
- `nginx-config.txt` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (reference configuration)
- `test.css` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (Tailwind test file)

**Reason:** Planning documents and reference configurations are not part of the application runtime. The test.css file is a Tailwind processing test file.

## üß™ Development Components (Review Before Delete)

### Diagnostic Components
- `src/components/BackendDiagnostic.jsx` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Review (diagnostic tool)
- `src/components/GSTINDemo.jsx` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Review (demo component)
- `src/components/Layout-old.jsx` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (old layout version)

### Additional Old/Unused JS/JSX Files
- `src/pages/Invoices_backup.jsx` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (backup of old invoices page)
- `src/components/Layout-new.jsx` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (alternative layout not in use)

**Reason:** BackendDiagnostic and GSTINDemo might be useful for troubleshooting. Layout-old.jsx is clearly an old version. Invoices_backup.jsx is a backup file - the main `src/pages/Invoices.jsx` exists and is actively used. Layout-new.jsx is an alternative layout file that's not being imported anywhere.

## üì¶ Generated Files & Temporary Data

### Invoice Files (Conditional)
- Files in `backend/invoices/` folder - ‚ö†Ô∏è Review individually
  - `invoice-TEST-*.pdf/html` - ‚úÖ Safe to delete (test invoices)
  - Production invoices - ‚ùå Keep (business data)

**Reason:** Test invoice files can be deleted, but production invoice files contain important business data.

## üîÑ Deployment Files (Conditional)

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy.sh` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep if using manual deployment
- `ecosystem.config.js` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep if using PM2
- `fly.toml` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep if deploying to Fly.io
- `Dockerfile` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep if using Docker

**Reason:** These are only safe to delete if you're not using the respective deployment methods.

- Deployment files (based on deployment method)
- Production invoice files (business data)

## üóëÔ∏è Cleanup Commands

### Safe cleanup (copy and paste):
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/touficks/Documents/gst-invoice-system

# Remove documentation files
rm -f README.mdx README-ADVANCED.md SETTINGS_FUNCTIONALITY.md
rm -f VPS_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md BILLING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md

# Remove debug scripts
rm -f backend/verify-imports.js backend/health-check-test.js backend/full-backend-check.js
rm -f check-local-setup.sh fix-vps.sh fix-common-issues.sh

# Remove planning & config files
rm -f OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.js nginx-config.txt test.css

# Remove old components
rm -f src/components/Layout-old.jsx
rm -f src/components/Layout-new.jsx
rm -f src/pages/Invoices_backup.jsx

# Remove test invoice files (be careful with this)
rm -f backend/invoices/invoice-TEST-*.pdf backend/invoices/invoice-TEST-*.html

echo "‚úÖ Cleanup completed successfully!"
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After cleanup, verify the application still works:
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `cd .. && npm run dev`
3. Test core functionality: login, create invoice, generate PDF

**Total Space Saved:** Approximately 2-5 MB (mostly documentation and debug files)
**Risk Level:** Very Low - No functional code will be removed
