🗓️ **DATE PICKER FIX GUIDE**

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Created DateInput Component**: Specialized component for date inputs without conflicting icons
2. **Removed Icon Conflicts**: The calendar icon in InputField was potentially blocking clicks
3. **Added Debugging**: Console logs to track date changes
4. **Optimized Styling**: Added `colorScheme: 'light'` and proper cursor/pointer-events

## 🎯 **Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Date picker calendar not opening
- ✅ Date selection not working
- ✅ Icon interference with native browser date picker
- ✅ Event handling problems

## 🚀 **Testing Instructions:**

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open Dashboard** and scroll to "Filter by Date Range" section
3. **Test the date inputs**:
   - Click on "Start Date" field → Calendar should open
   - Click on "End Date" field → Calendar should open
   - Select dates → Should update the input values
4. **Check console** for "Date change:" logs when selecting dates

## 📱 **Expected Behavior:**
- Date inputs should be clickable and responsive
- Browser's native date picker should open
- Selected dates should appear in the input fields
- Console should log date changes
- Filter button should work with selected dates

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working:**
Check for:
- Browser compatibility (try Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
- CSS conflicts in browser dev tools
- JavaScript errors in console
- Try different date formats

The DateInput component is specifically designed to work with browser date pickers! 📅
