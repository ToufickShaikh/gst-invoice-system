ðŸŽ‰ **BUTTON ERROR FIXED!**

## âœ… **Issue Resolved:**
The error `ReferenceError: ref is not defined` has been fixed by removing the `ref={ref}` prop from the button element since we simplified the component without `forwardRef`.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed:**
- Removed `ref={ref}` from the button element in Button.jsx line 112
- The Button component now works without requiring ref forwarding
- Build completes successfully without errors

## ðŸš€ **Testing Status:**
- âœ… Build: Successful
- âœ… Compilation: No errors
- âœ… Button component: Fixed
- âœ… Click handlers: Should now work

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps:**
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser developer tools (F12) â†’ Console
3. Click the Quick Actions buttons
4. Verify you see console logs and navigation works

The buttons should now be fully functional! ðŸŽ¯
